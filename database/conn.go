				MaxIdleConns: This parameter determines the maximum number of idle (unused) connections that the connection pool maintains.
			Set it based on the expected idle connections during normal operation. A value between 2 to 4 times the number of CPU cores on your EC2 instance is often a good starting point.
		For t3a.medium with 2 vCPUs, consider setting MaxIdleConns to 4 to 8.

		For a target of 500 RPS, you may need to experiment with different values to find the optimal setting.
		Start with a conservative value and gradually increase it while monitoring the database and application server metrics for signs of overload or contention.
		A value between 50 to 100 could be a reasonable starting point, but you may need to adjust it based on performance testing and monitoring results.
